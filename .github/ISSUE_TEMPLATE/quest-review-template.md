> **Commentaire:**



- **Ressources**:
    - [ ] Use the minimum necessary to acquire the skill => curation is about choosing the best resources, not all the resources available
    - [ ] Check the quality of the resources and the format.
    - [ ] Qualify the resource : what is “Essential”, “Optional”, an “Example”, etc
    - [ ] Each resource should be explained (what the student will learn).
    - [ ] Multiple formats 

Think of the different type of learners (for the same concept, a video and a textual resource can be advised to allow a student choosing the best format).

    - [ ] The text is clear and create links between the sections
    - [ ] There are no grammar/spelling mistakes
    - [ ] The writing is good (short sentences, good writing manner)
    - [ ] The writing is homogeneous
    - [ ] If a story is told, check that the content doesn’t hurt anyone (impersonal)
    - [ ] The translation is good (if translated in English)

> **Commentaire:**


- **Challenge**:
    - [ ] The challenge should check that the learning objectives are reached, that the skills are acquired

Eg. objective: “Learn how to use Google Colaboratory and create your first notebook”

Put some illustrations to make the quest more vivid.

    - [ ] Illustrations are relevant (to the topic given).

> **Commentaire:**

- **Categories/navigation menu**

    - [ ] Good balance between the length of your content and the number of categories (navigation menu on the left)
    - [ ] No content in the Introduction part (because the “Introduction category” is visible before the student click on the “Do the challenge” icone).
